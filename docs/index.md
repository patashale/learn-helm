[Helm](https://helm.sh) is one of  the package managers for [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io).

This package manager [project](https://github.com/deis/deis) was created by a company named [Deis](https://github.com/deis) during the year 2015, which was later acquired by [Microsoft](https://microsoft.com). Microsoft began working on the project, with [initial commit](https://github.com/helm/helm-classic/commit/ecad6e2ef9523a0218864ec552bbfc724f0b9d3d) recorded on October 20, 2015, and released it at [KubeCon](https://www.cncf.io/events) on November under the brand name [Helm Classic](https://github.com/helm/helm-classic).

In January 2016, Helm Classic was merged with Google's **Deployment Manager for Kubernetes**, which is now called [Helm](https://github.com/helm/helm). Helm later joined CNCF on June 1, 2018, released Helm Hub, now known as [Artifact Hub](https://artifacthub.io) and achieved `graduated` status within CNCF in April 2020.
