This package manager [project](https://github.com/deis/deis){:target="_blank"} was created by a company named [Deis](https://github.com/deis){:target="_blank"} during the year 2015, which was later acquired by [Microsoft](https://microsoft.com){:target="_blank"}. Microsoft began working on the project, with [initial commit](https://github.com/helm/helm-classic/commit/ecad6e2ef9523a0218864ec552bbfc724f0b9d3d){:target="_blank"} recorded on October 20, 2015, and released it at [KubeCon](https://www.cncf.io/events){:target="_blank"} on November under the brand name [Helm Classic](https://github.com/helm/helm-classic){:target="_blank"}.
